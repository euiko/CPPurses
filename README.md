# TUI Library
__CPPurses__ is a Terminal User Interface(TUI) Library built on top of
[ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/). It defines a framework of
[Widgets](https://github.com/a-n-t-h-o-n-y/CPPurses/wiki/Widgets),
[Layouts](https://github.com/a-n-t-h-o-n-y/CPPurses/wiki/Layouts), and
[Events](https://github.com/a-n-t-h-o-n-y/CPPurses/wiki/Events) that let you focus on
user interface design, while boilerplate common to ncurses applications is
handled behind the scenes.

CPPurses contains a collection of common Widgets that can be pieced together to
create a composite application. It is also possible to expand and build on top
of existing Widgets, or to create completely new Widget types, by overriding a
few virtual functions.

This is a __work in progress__. The API is not stable.

## Installation
CPPurses depends on two header only libraries, this repo
includes them as git submodules. You'll need NCurses installed on your system.
```
git clone https://github.com/a-n-t-h-o-n-y/CPPurses.git
mkdir CPPurses/build && cd CPPurses/build
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote  # Pull in dependencies
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..               # Generate Makefiles
make                                              # Build library
make demos                                        # Build demos(optional)
sudo make install    # Install header and library archive to system defaults
```
Installing the library with CMake will place the headers and the library
archive in the standard GNU install directories.

## Using the Library
For projects using CPPurses, link with cppurses, ncurses and your system's
thread library. If you have installed the library your linker flags will be:
```
-lcppurses -lncurses -pthread
```
for most Linux distributions.
